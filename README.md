## Projects

### Standards/lexicals

- [VIAF， The Virtual International Authority File](http://viaf.org/)
  - The VIAF® (Virtual International Authority File) combines multiple name authority files into a single OCLC-hosted name authority service. The goal of the service is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking widely-used authority files and making that information available on the Web.
  
- [WordNet](https://wordnet.princeton.edu/)
- WordNet® is a large lexical database of English. Nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs are grouped into sets of cognitive synonyms (synsets), each expressing a distinct concept.
- by Princeton University

### Knowledge Graph

- [schema.org](https://schema.org/)
  - founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex
  - to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
  - can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD
