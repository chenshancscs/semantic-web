## Projects

### Standards

- [VIAF， The Virtual International Authority File](http://viaf.org/)
  - The VIAF® (Virtual International Authority File) combines multiple name authority files into a single OCLC-hosted name authority service. The goal of the service is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking widely-used authority files and making that information available on the Web.

### Knowledge Graph

- [schema.org](https://schema.org/)
  - founded by Google, Microsoft, Yahoo and Yandex
  - to create, maintain, and promote schemas for structured data on the Internet, on web pages, in email messages, and beyond.
  - can be used with many different encodings, including RDFa, Microdata and JSON-LD
